A command line version of the ancient mathematical puzzle Towers of Hanoi built with stacks as the underlying data structure of the game stacks.

The game starts off with three stacks and many disks and the objective is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

The game has three rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
